After many years of avoiding ghosts in mazes while treasure-hunting, Cap-Man has decided to build himself a home maze, retire, and eat his ice cream in peace. However, the ghosts have not given up, and are back for revenge! They're coming to steal his ice cream!

Build and upgrade gem towers using the pellet resources to help Cap-Man protect his ice cream!
Beware! Each wave of ghosts will get stronger, requiring more hits to dispel.
